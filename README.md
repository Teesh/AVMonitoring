# AV Console README

## Contents  
The folder structure is all f'ed up so here's what is actually important:

### /usmnet  
The folder that houses everything important.  The index on this page is not used.  The .ftpconfig file has the details on how I connected Atom to the server.  The usmnet and src folder inside this folder are useless as well.

### /usmnet/public_html
The actual web root.  All files in here are used and commented

### /usmnet/resources
Stuff to keep out of the web root, like the config file and the cronjob script
